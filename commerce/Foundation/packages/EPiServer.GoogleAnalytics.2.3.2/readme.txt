EPiServer.GoogleAnalytics


Installation
============

Starting from release 1.5.0.7516, EPiServer Google Analytics add-on has been converted to standard nuget packages. 
This means that content files and assemblies will be added to the project.
As a part of the conversion the previously installed add-on packages needs to be removed.


New package format helps you install, or upgrade an existing add-on through Visual Studio, 
and work with the EPiServer Google Analytics API.

Please go to http://world.episerver.com/documentation/Items/user-guides/ 
for more topics targeted to editors and merchandisers/marketers, configuration and customization.


For EPiServer Commerce Support, please install a separate package: EPiServer.GoogleAnalytics.Commerce.
